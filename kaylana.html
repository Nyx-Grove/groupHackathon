            This is Asia, she is 10yrs old and has dyslexia. Asia has a hard time with learning in school and they don’t offer tutors. 
            Her mother has decided to sign her up for an online program called GRG where she gets free classes for her disorder from professionals. 
            Here is where she meets Ms. Walker.

            <h3></h3>
  
            <p class="">
                Ms. Walker and Asia have class together on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Class starts at 5pm and ends at 7pm. 
                In the beginning Ms. Walker askes Asia what she did in school that  day and how much did she understand. 
                From there Ms. Walker would help her with the parts that were a bit more difficult to learn because of her disability. 
                They would work on this for about 30 minutes then take a 15 minute break. From there they would take another 20 minutes for school then 30 minutes for lunch. 
                The last 21 minutes is spent on anything else Asia needs help with that they might not be teaching her in school at the moment.  
                Ms. Walker has been a great help to Asia. Sometimes Ms. Walker needs to repeat things but she is still patient when this happens because she knows she’ll need a pit more help. 
                She also talks with Asia’s parents every now and then so they can know ways to help her out too. 
                So far Asia has been with GRG for a couple months but she has said that she loves it and will stay as long as she can.
